## Building the library ##

You will need the [`sbt`](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) scala/java build
tool installed on your system.  Please follow
[the installation directions on the `sbt` site](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).

If you have the Android SDK installed on your system, make sure the
environment variable `ANDROID_HOME` in pointing to the SDK root
directory.  If you don't have it, `sbt` will fetch it for you when you
package the library with `sbt package`.
